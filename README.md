# Quant API Service #

This application is a light-weight Backend API service, built with Python and Flask framework.


## Prerequisite

* Download and install Python 3.
* Ensure you have the `venv` module installed.


## Setting Up Development

1. Create a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv <name_of_venv>`

2. Download all libraries with `pip3 install -r app/requirements.txt`

3. Activate virtual environment with `source <name_of_venv>/bin/activate`

4. Change to workspace dir `cd /app` and Create the `.env` file using the `.env.example` - config your real falcon lib path here


## Running Project
Make sure all the following commands are run under work dir `/app`, if not, run `cd /app` first.

There are many ways to run/debug the server, including 
- from command line directly (easiest)
- by PyCharm Run configurations (recommend)
- from docker (optional)

### Command line running
Open file `main_app.py` on PyCharm and then right-click, select `Debug Flask (app/main_app.py)`

or just run the following command on terminal:
```bash
$ python3 main_app.py
```

### PyCharm Run configurations
reference [Run/Debug Configuration: Python](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/run-debug-configuration-python.html)

1. open the Run/Debug Configuration add a python configuration
2. specify *script path* to `<your-real-path-to>/app/main_app`
3. [optional] add an environment variable: `FLASK_DEBUG=True`

done

### Docker Run
Need docker daemon installed, pass here


## Testing API
we can use a GUI client such as `postman` to test with api, the url is `http://127.0.0.1:5000` by default, make sure to add
an authorization header with key: `X-Api-Key` and the value defined in your .env

here is an example with built-in curl command:
```shell
curl -i -X GET \
  -H "X-Api-Key:C75BDA2B0F854B26BC55B15150ABCDB0" \
  'http://127.0.0.1:5000/'
```

there is a chrome plugin [Talend API Tester](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/talend-api-tester-free-ed/aejoelaoggembcahagimdiliamlcdmfm)
we can use to test apis in a GUI way.

## Set up PyCharm external falcon lib
Cause falcon is an external lib out of our project, so pycharm code intelligent canâ€™t detect that, but we can add it manually

1. Focus on the left block of PyCharm, on the project tab, expand to `External Libraries > Python 3.x.. > site-packages`, right-click
on the `site-packages`, then select Open in Terminal
2. On the opened terminal, run 
    ```shell
    ln -s <REAL_PATH_TO_YOUR_FALCON_LIB> ./falcon
    ```
    remember to replace <REAL_PATH_TO_YOUR_FALCON_LIB> here to your real path such as
    `/home/falcon`
